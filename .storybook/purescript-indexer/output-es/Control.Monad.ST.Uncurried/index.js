// | This module defines types for STf uncurried functions, as well as
// | functions for converting back and forth between them.
// |
// | The general naming scheme for functions and types in this module is as
// | follows:
// |
// | * `STFn{N}` means, an uncurried function which accepts N arguments and
// |   performs some STs. The first N arguments are the actual function's
// |   argument. The last type argument is the return type.
// | * `runSTFn{N}` takes an `STFn` of N arguments, and converts it into
// |   the normal PureScript form: a curried function which returns an ST
// |   action.
// | * `mkSTFn{N}` is the inverse of `runSTFn{N}`. It can be useful for
// |   callbacks.
// |
